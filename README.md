# Share Spotify Likes

This client-side app allows you to automatically fetch all your Spotify likes and create a new playlist from them.

## Why?

You can't share your liked tracks on Spotify right now. The only way is to create a playlist and add all these likes to it.
The problem is you can't (right now) select multiple tracks at once to add to a playlist. This app makes it easy (no, you won't need to click 800 times to add every track).

## Does it store anything?

No, there is no server involved here. Everything happens in your browser. It's between Spotify and you only.

## Is the playlist updated every time I like a track?

Sadly, no. I don't think it's possible with Spotify's web API right now. You will have to create a new playlist.
